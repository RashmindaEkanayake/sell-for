Since this is a clean frontend project using vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS (via CDN), you can run it easily:

1. **Option A: Simple Open**
   - Just open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

2. **Option B: Live Server (Recommended)**
   - If using VS Code, right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
   - Alternatively, use any local server like `npx serve .`.
